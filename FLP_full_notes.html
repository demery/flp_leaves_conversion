                    of Matthew and Mark record that Christ came upon two fishermen in a boat on the
                    Sea of Galilee, the brothers Peter and Andrew whom he called to be his
                    disciples. The Gospel of John tells the story differently. It is Andrew, one of
                    two disciples of John the Baptist, who sees Christ first and then runs to tell
                    his brother Peter (John 1:39-41). The iconography of this initial combines the
                    two different accounts: Andrew and Peter are fisherman, but it is Andrew who
                    recognizes Christ first while Peter has his back turned.</td>

                    ...&quot; (The crucified one rose on the third day). It is followed by the first
                    words of Psalms 109-112, which were recited on Sundays at Vespers. The elaborate
                    border contains several miniatures embedded within the frame. In the lower
                    border, the central miniature contains the figures of St. Zenobius, the first
                    bishop of Florence, and his two deacons, Sts. Eugenius and Crescentius. They are
                    flanked by two unidentified martyr saints, who hold palm branches. A roundel in
                    the right border contains four virgin martyr saints, also holding palm branches.
                    A curious scene in the upper border depicts three ducks wading in a pond. The
                    Classical decorative motifs throughout the border are commonly found in

                    The text that this initial begins cannot be identified since the cutting has
                    been pasted to a mat. The scene shows St. Augustine giving his Rule to a group
                    of Domincan friars. His Rule was intended for the Augustinian Order, but the
                    Dominicans adopted it as well following the example of their founder St. Dominic
                    who began his religious life as an Augustinian. This cutting has been attributed
                    to the Sienese illuminator Pietro di Giovanni d&apos;Ambrogio, active from 1428,
                    when he entered the Sienese painter&apos;s guild, to his death in 1449.</td>

                    in Bruges, ca. 1415-1455. The name derives from the group&apos;s frequent use of
                    gold foliate ornament painted on backgrounds of flat color.</td>

                    Laurentian Library in Florence, Cod. Cor. 39), indicating that he was originally

                    illumination in the Free Library&apos;s collection. Nearly thirty years after
                    the execution of these initials, the character of Italian illumination and
                    painting would fundamentally change under the leadership of artists such as the
                    Florentine painter Giotto. The abstract tendencies in medieval art seen in these
                    cuttings would eventually give way to a more naturalistic approach to
                    representation, marking the beginning of the Renaissance in the history of
                    art.</td>

                    This initial begins an unusual chant sung at the first response for the first
                    nocturn of Matins of the feast of St. Peter of Verona (Apr. 29), &quot;Petre
                    sydus aureum summinas honorem candoris ....&quot; St. Peter (b. 1206 - April 6,
                    1252), was a thirteenth-century Dominican preacher and inquisitor. According to
                    his legend, he was attacked by members of the heretical sect known as the
                    Cathars, whom St. Peter had preached vehemently against. His attackers struck
                    him in the head with an axe. When the saint rose up to proclaim &quot;Credo in
                    Deum&quot; (I believe in God), the first article of faith, his attackers then
                    fatally stabbed him in the heart. In this initial, both wounds are represented.
                    This initial has been attributed to an artist working within the circle of the
                    Venetian illuminator Cristoforo Cortese, active from ca. 1399 to before 1445
                    when a document refers to him as already dead. Several other leaves in the Free

                    once decorated a psalter, as images such as this were sometimes included at the

                    religious manuscripts. As the cutting lacks any text, it is difficult to
                    identify the context for which this image was made.</td>

                    1390 to 1415. He illuminated eight other leaves in the Free Library&apos;s

                    St. Nicholas, whose legendary acts of charity led to his association with the

                    there in 346. His relics remained there until May 9, 1087, when several citizens
                    of the Italian city of Bari took his bodily remains from Myra and brought them
                    to Bari, where they can be found today. For various reasons that legends always

                    guild&apos;s statutes or regulations. The reverse of this cutting contains the

                    well as later additions in a cursive script. The Archangel Michael treading on
                    the dragon was the symbol of the Porta Sant&apos;Angelo, one of the five gates
                    of medieval Perugia. The illumination has been attributed to Matteo di Ser

                    240). Although their precise function is difficult to determine, pattern books
                    allowed illuminators to show samples of their work or gave examples for
                    apprentices to copy. The artist of this initial may have used such a pattern
                    book when creating its design. Lewis E M 30:8 and E M 30:10-14 are from the same
                    volume or series of choir books.</td>

                    (1405-1481), the illuminator of this initial, was one of the most prolific
                    artists working in Siena during the fifteenth century. Many of Sano&apos;s
                    commissions came from religious communities, for whom he produced not only
                    illuminated manuscripts but also a number of altarpieces. The youthful features
                    of this saint suggest that this is St. John the Evangelist, who, like other the
                    other apostles, is normally depicted in bare feet. Closer inspection of
                    saint&apos;s feet bears out this identification: the orange stockings covering
                    the saint&apos;s feet are a later addition. His feet can be seen through the
                    thinly applied orange paint. This cutting belongs to a group of other cuttings

                    37 of the Digest discusses legal rights concerning inherited property. Although

                    monasticism. The illumination of this initial has been attributed to the Master

                    contains portions of the Gospel Lesson for Epiphany, beginning on this folio
                    with Luke 3:21, &quot;Factum est aute[m] cum baptizaretur omnis populus
                    ...&quot; (Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized). In medieval
                    celebrations of the Mass, the Gospel Lesson was intoned, or chanted, by a
                    deacon. In the initial D, a deacon points to a representation of the same book
                    from which a real deacon would chant the text. Opposite the initial, in the
                    right margin, are traces of instructions left for the illuminator, who would
                    come back after the text and musical notation had been inscribed to fill in the
                    spaces for the illumination. Although the note has been mostly trimmed away, it
                    indicates that an image of a deacon reading should be placed in the initial. |

                    who have not yet received a kingdom, but shall receive power as kings one hour
                    after the beast. These have one design: and their strength and power they shall
                    deliver to the beast. These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall
                    overcome them, because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and they that are
                    with him are called, and elect, and faithful.&quot; The Lamb is symbolic of
                    Christ and the kings can be said to represent the powers of the earthly world.

                    Great (272 AD - 337 A.D.). The True Cross was believed to have been made from

                    Founded in the thirteenth century, the university in Bologna became an important
                    center for the study of law in the Middle Ages. As a consequence, the city also
                    became one of the great centers for the production of legal manuscripts, many of
                    which, as these initials attest, were beautifully illuminated. These cuttings
                    belong to the same manuscript as Lewis E M 26:4 and 26:5. | Three initial

                    the first nocturn of Matins of the feast of St. Laurence (Aug. 10), &quot;Levita
                    Laurentius bonum opus operatus est ...&quot; (The Deacon Lawrence performed a
                    pious act). The iconography of the initial makes reference to the events
                    surrounding the martyrdom of the saint. According to his legend, Pope Sixtus II
                    entrusted Laurence with the material wealth of the Church when it was still
                    outlawed. Shortly thereafter, Sixtus was executed, and Laurence distributed the
                    wealth among the poor. When the Emperor Valerian commanded Laurence to appear
                    for his execution, the saint was told to bring along the treasure with which the
                    pope had entrusted him. When he arrived, a multitude of Rome&apos;s crippled,
                    blind, sick, and indigent came with him. St. Laurence announced that these were
                    the true treasures of the Church. Laurence was executed by being grilled over
                    hot coals; the gridiron is his attribute.</td>

                    believes are Christ&apos;s blasphemies, an act recorded in the Gospels of
                    Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In the next scene, Christ is blindfolded and mocked by
                    tormentors. In the far right, Pilate&apos;s wife, as told in the Gospel of
                    Matthew, warns Pilate not to condemn the innocent man because she had a dream in
                    which she suffered on account of his death. &amp;#x0D; These scenes and another

                    red, blue, and light brown inks, is similar to the penwork initials of
                    Guinifortus de Vicomercato, an illuminator active in central Italy in the
                    mid-fifteenth century. Guinifortus signed his name in a pattern book of penwork
                    initials now in the Lilly Library at the University of Indiana (MS Ricketts
                    240). Although their precise function is difficult to determine, pattern books
                    allowed illuminators to show samples of their work or gave examples for
                    apprentices to copy. The artist of this initial may have used such a pattern
                    book when creating its design. Lewis E M 30:8 and E M 30:10-14 are from the same
                    volume.</td>

                    true spouse, instead of the profane music of the ceremony. This account led to

                    the Holy Trinity and indivisible unity). Representations of the Trinity could
                    vary from those that present God as the father, the Holy Spirit as a dove, and
                    Christ as the man Jesus, to images such as this one that present a more nuanced
                    interpretation of this difficult concept. Here, the artist presents the Trinity
                    as a man with three identical faces merged into one head, an image that
                    emphasizes the unity glorified in this Introit. Niccol&#242; di ser Sozzo
                    Tegliacci is a Sienese painter and an illuminator. Little is known about his
                    life: in 1348 he was in debt to the city of Siena, and in 1363 he was mentioned
                    in Siena&apos;s Libro delle Arti (Book of the Arts).</td>

                    St. Stephen is given the title &quot;Protomartyr&quot; because he was the first
                    martyr of the faith. The Acts of the Apostles record that he was stoned to death
                    while preaching the Word of God (Acts 7:58).</td>

                    liturgical division of the psalms according to the canonical hours. Psalm 38 was
                    read every day at Matins on Tuesdays. As is typical for the illustration of this
                    psalm, King David points to his mouth as he prays to God, literally acting out,
                    by pointing to his mouth, the first words of the psalm.</td>

                    been part of the border decoration of a large folio, commemorates the reburial
                    of the relics of St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr, in the grave of St.
                    Laurence, the third-century deacon and celebrated victim of the persecutions of
                    the Roman emperor Valerian. St. Stephen&apos;s relics were brought from
                    Constantinople to Rome by Pope Pelagius II (578-590) during the construction of
                    the church of San Lorenzo fuori le Mura (St. Laurence outside the Walls) , which
                    still stands today in Rome. On his orders, the relics of the first Christian
                    martyr were interred with the remains of St. Lawrence, whose grave is enshrined
                    within the church. This cutting and Lewis E M 25:8 are from a codex known as the
                    Laudario of the Compagnia di Sant&apos;Agnese. The codex survives only in
                    fragments now dispersed among European and American libraries and museums. A
                    laudario contains hymns in the vernacular language to be sung by members of a
                    lay religious community, in this case the community known as the Compagnia di
                    Sant&apos;Agnese of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. The original codex was
                    illuminated by two Florentine artists: Pacino di Bonaguida, the artist of the
                    Free Library&apos;s cuttings, and the Master of the Dominican Effigies, an
                    anonymous artist and contemporary of Pacino.</td>

                    survives only in fragments now dispersed among European and American libraries
                    and museums. A laudario contains hymns in the vernacular language to be sung by

                    Compagnia di Sant&apos;Agnese of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. The

                    the artist of the Free Library&apos;s cuttings, and the Master of the Dominican

                    body follows his deposition from the Cross. The Virgin is joined in her sorrow
                    by other witnesses to the Crucifixion; in this initial John the Evangelist, Mary
                    Magdalene, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus accompany her. Lamentation scenes
                    such as this one formed the basis for the popular late medieval devotional image
                    known as the Piet&#224;, in which the Virgin mourns alone as she cradles
                    Christ&apos;s body. Attavante degli Attavanti (b. 1452-1520/25) was one of
                    Florence&apos;s most sought after illuminators of the late fifteenth and early
                    sixteenth centuries. Among his many patrons, were Federigo da Montefeltro, the
                    Duke of Urbino (14778), and Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary (1458-1490).</td>

                    The use of Old Testament imagery in this Christian context has a theological
                    explanation. According to the Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible and Christian
                    Old Testament, the blood of a sacrificial lamb marked the homes of the
                    Israelites so that the angel sent to slay the first-born sons of the Egyptians
                    (the tenth plague) would pass over their homes. Since early times, Christians
                    saw this event as a prefiguration of Christ&apos;s death in which he became the
                    sacrificial Lamb of God for the salvation of mankind.</td>

                    St. Dominic&apos;s legend, a friar living in Brescia saw at the hour of the
                    saint&apos;s death a vision in which Christ and the Virgin Mary lowered two
                    ladders upon which St. Dominic&apos;s soul ascended into heaven. This initial

                    according to his role as the author of these sung prayers. The initial was

                    Much of late medieval devotion centered on prayers to the Virgin to intercede on
                    one&apos;s behalf with her son Jesus Christ. Her special relationship with
                    Christ led, in large part, the extreme popularity of the cult of the Virgin in
                    the late Middle Ages. The initial was illuminated by the Italian painter Neri da

                    page, as does the fact that the work appears as no. 14 in Bergquist&apos;s

                    top leaf has several selections from the Book of Matthew that are usually used
                    during the 21st to 24th Sunday after Pentecost; the bottom leaf quotes Jeremiah
                    31:12 and Psalm 4.&amp;#x0D; The notation is very similar to Beneventan chant;
                    however, Beneventan chant is accompanied by an entirely different script from
                    the one seen in these leaves. Extant examples of Beneventan chant are also
                    extremely rare, hence it is unlikely that these leaves are from a Beneventan

                <td>The ancient Greeks had developed a system of musical notation that
                    differentiated between instrumental and sung music, and even indicated rhythmic
                    value. The practice of writing music, as well as the practice of many arts,
                    vanished after the fall of Rome.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Charlemagne, the first
                    Holy Roman emperor (742&amp;ndash;814) restored learning and education to the
                    Western world and the empire over which he reigned. He implemented a
                    standardization of written text and music throughout his empire, which extended
                    through much of modern-day Western and Central Europe. The emperor employed
                    Alcuin, a scholar from England, to run a school and scriptorium in
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, Charlemagnes favored residence. The resulting, highly legible
                    script was Caroline minuscule. A musical notation was developed, too, in the
                    form of the so-called St. Gall notation, named after the abbey in St. Gall,
                    modern-day Switzerland.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This leaf is written in Caroline
                    minuscule, with unheightened or nondiastematic neumes. Neumes are the earliest
                    notes used in plainchant, which is the monophonic unison chant of the Christian
                    liturgies. Early on, they were squiggles and dots, like the ones displayed here.
                    These neumes do not show the relative pitch between notes, and there is no
                    indicated base pitch. None of these were necessary to the singer, however; the
                    notation served as a reminder of the relative pitches to singers who would
                    already have been familiar with the melody.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The text is 2
                    Corinthians 6:1-10, Exhortamur (vos) ne in vacuum gratiam Dei recipiatis. . .
                    (We exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain), which is the

                <td>The ancient Greeks had developed a system of musical notation that
                    differentiated between instrumental and sung music, and even indicated rhythmic
                    value. The practice of writing music, as well as the practice of many arts,
                    vanished after the fall of Rome.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Charlemagne, the first
                    Holy Roman emperor (742&amp;ndash;814) restored learning and education to the
                    Western world and the empire over which he reigned. He implemented a
                    standardization of written text and music throughout his empire, which extended
                    through much of modern-day Western and Central Europe. The emperor employed
                    Alcuin, a scholar from England, to run a school and scriptorium in
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, Charlemagnes favored residence. The resulting, highly legible
                    script was Caroline minuscule. A musical notation was developed, too, in the
                    form of the so-called St. Gall notation, named after the abbey in St. Gall,
                    modern-day Switzerland.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This leaf is written in Caroline
                    minuscule, with unheightened or nondiastematic neumes. Neumes are the earliest
                    notes used in plainchant, which is the monophonic unison chant of the Christian
                    liturgies. Early on, they were squiggles and dots, like the ones displayed here.
                    These neumes do not show the relative pitch between notes, and there is no
                    indicated base pitch. None of these were necessary to the singer, however; the
                    notation served as a reminder of the relative pitches to singers who would
                    already have been familiar with the melody.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The text is 2
                    Corinthians 6:1-10, Exhortamur (vos) ne in vacuum gratiam Dei recipiatis. . .

                    has been simply rubricated (initials drawn in blue and red ink for delineation
                    and ease of reading). Additionally, it is clear that there are many erasures and
                    rewritings of the music in this leaf. Erasing parchment involved scraping the
                    page (which is animal skin) with pumice or other scraping tools. It is possible
                    or even probable that the leaf was meant to be decorated in the borders and that
                    it was never completed. This leaf and the other leaf in this case are wonderful
                    artifacts that allow us to see some of the stages of manuscript preparation from
                    the Middle Ages.</td>

                    survive), allowing each Credo to occupy a single opening, as in Old Hall (Lbl
                    57950). Two of the Credos have concordances with known compositions, supplying
                    attributions: one to Dunstaple, the other to &amp;#39;Anglicanus&amp;#39;.
                    (These were identified by Peter Wright. See now EECM 55, nos 16, 45, 46). The
                    numbering of the folios (A as the wider leaf and B the smaller) is provisional,
                    as it is not entirely clear which way the bifolio was originally folded. All
                    four pieces are in full black notation with red coloration.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D;
